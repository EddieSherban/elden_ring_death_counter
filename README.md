# elden_ring_death_counter
 Image processing OpenCV Python program that shows number of deaths on the screen and detects when a death has happened

Deaths can be manually incremented or decremented using the window in case of errors. A "deaths.txt" is written at the end of the program, which can be modified to any value, which will be read at the start of the program.

Currently only tested on my windows computer, i'm not sure how functionality with other OS works, or if it even works on other computers.

Program can be exited out of by control-clicking the "Deaths" text.
