# elden_ring_death_counter
 Image processing OpenCV Python program that automatically detects and shows number of deaths on the screen

 # Controlling the program and exiting
  A upon running the program, a "Manual Death Counter" window is opened, where deaths can be incremented or decremented in case of errors.
  A "deaths.txt" is written at the end of the program, which can be modified to any value. It'll will be read at the start of the program.
  Program can be exited out of by control-clicking the "Deaths" text.

 # Note on Operating Systems
   Currently only tested on my windows computer, i'm not sure how functionality with other OS works, or if it even works on other computers.
