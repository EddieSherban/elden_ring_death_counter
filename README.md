# elden_ring_death_counter
 Image processing OpenCV Python program that automatically detects and shows number of deaths on the screen

 # Controlling the program and exiting
  • Go to the bin folder, and make sure you don't delete the png. "deaths.txt" can be deleted.  
  • Upon program start, a "Manual Death Counter" window is opened, where deaths can be incremented or decremented in case of errors.  
  • A "deaths.txt" is written at the end of the program, which can be modified to any integer. It'll be read at the start next time.  
**• You can exit the program by control-clicking the "Deaths" text.**

 # Note on Operating Systems
   Currently only tested on my windows computer, i'm not sure how functionality with other OS works, or if it even works on other computers.

# TO FIX:
 There's this weird bug where the place that the application runs from will not be clickable. For example if you run the script from VSCode, VSCode is no longer clickable, but you can alt tab to it and edit text, so you have to ALT+F4 then reopen it. Same thing goes for if you open the program from File Explorer: when the program ends, Explorer is not clickable unless you switch to it, then ALT+F4 out of it, and reopen it.
