# elden_ring_death_counter
 Image processing OpenCV Python program that automatically detects and shows number of deaths on the screen

 # Controlling the program and exiting
  • Go to the bin folder, and make sure you don't delete the png. It's necessary for the image comparison. "deaths.txt" can be deleted.
  • Upon program start, a "Manual Death Counter" window is opened, where deaths can be incremented or decremented in case of errors.
  • A "deaths.txt" is written at the end of the program, which can be modified to any integer. It'll be read at the start next time.
**  • You can exit the program by control-clicking the "Deaths" text.**

 # Note on Operating Systems
   Currently only tested on my windows computer, i'm not sure how functionality with other OS works, or if it even works on other computers.
